# Rawli Analytics — Community Tech Docs

**Version:** 1.0

## Overview
Rawli Analytics is a prediction‑market intelligence platform built for BNB Chain operators. We deliver clear, risk‑aware signals so traders and teams can make high‑confidence decisions faster.

## What We’re Solving
Prediction markets are noisy. Data is fragmented, signals are inconsistent, and execution context is often missing. Rawli Analytics focuses on turning raw market feeds into structured insight—probability trends, risk signals, and decision context—so users can act with precision.

## Core Pillars (LLM‑Assisted Intelligence)
Rawli Analytics uses an LLM‑assisted pipeline to convert market activity into actionable insight:

1. **Signal Extraction**
   - Normalize market events, price changes, and liquidity shifts into structured features.
   - Extract high‑impact deltas and regime changes.

2. **Inference Layer (LLM‑Assisted)**
   - Summarize market state into readable intelligence.
   - Highlight probability changes, confidence bands, and narrative shifts.

3. **Execution Context**
   - Present actionable context: risk score, alert triggers, and timing windows.
   - Keep the focus on decision readiness, not raw data overload.

## Data Source
**Current primary source:** Polymarket.

We are expanding coverage to additional prediction markets and on‑chain venues. Each new source is normalized into a consistent schema to preserve signal quality across markets.

## Risk & Alert Engine
Rawli’s risk engine is designed for signal confidence and exposure control:

- **Risk scoring** based on volatility and probability drift
- **Alert triggers** for rapid market movement, liquidity changes, and confidence breaks
- **Threshold configuration** so teams can set their own risk tolerance

## Token Utility (RWAN)
RWAN supports platform access and incentives:

- Access tiers for advanced analytics
- Staking benefits and reward mechanisms
- Future execution‑related utilities tied to platform usage
